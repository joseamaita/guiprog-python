# wxPython

## Introduction

wxPython is a **GUI toolkit** for the Python programming language. It 
allows Python programmers to create programs with a robust, highly 
functional graphical user interface, simply and easily. It is 
implemented as a Python extension module (native code) that wraps the 
popular **wxWidgets** cross platform GUI library, which is written in 
C++.

Like Python and wxWidgets, wxPython is **Open Source** which means that 
it is free for anyone to use and the source code is available for anyone 
to look at and modify. Or anyone can contribute fixes or enhancements to 
the project.

wxPython is a **cross-platform** toolkit. This means that the same 
program will run on multiple platforms without modification. Currently 
supported platforms are 32-bit Microsoft Windows, most Unix or unix-like 
systems, and Macintosh OS X.

Since the language is Python, wxPython programs are **simple, easy** 
to write and easy to understand.
