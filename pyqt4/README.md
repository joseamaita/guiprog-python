# PyQt4

## Introduction

PyQt4 is a set of Python bindings for v4 and v5 of the Qt application 
framework from Digia. PyQt allows you to combine all the advantages of 
Qt and Python. With PyQt, you can include Qt libraries in Python code, 
enabling you to write GUI applications in Python. In other words, PyQt 
allows you to access all the facilities provided by Qt through the 
Python code.

Qt is a set of C++ libraries and development tools that includes 
platform independent abstractions for graphical user interfaces, 
networking, threads, Unicode, regular expressions, SQL databases, SVG, 
OpenGL, XML, a fully functional web browser, a help system, a multimedia 
framework, user and application settings, as well as a rich collection 
of GUI widgets. PyQt4 implements 440 of these classes as a set of Python 
modules.

Qt classes employ a signal/slot mechanism for communicating between 
objects that is type safe but loosely coupled making it easy to create 
re-usable software components.

Qt also includes Qt Designer, a graphical user interface designer. PyQt 
is able to generate Python code from Qt Designer. It is also possible to 
add new GUI controls written in Python to Qt Designer.

PyQt4 supports the Windows, Linux, UNIX and MacOS/X platforms.

PyQt4 does not include Qt itself, you must obtain it separately.
