# Guide for GUI Programming with Python

## Introduction

The Python core language has no built-in support for graphical user 
interfaces. As such, any support for GUIs must come from libraries 
external to Python, and many such libraries have been developed.

There are many GUI frameworks (or toolkits) available for Python; some 
are traditionally bundled with Python, using Tk (Tkinter), some offer 
cross-platform solutions, as well as bindings to platform-specific 
technologies.

## Popular Python GUI Frameworks or Toolkits to Consider

* [Tkinter](tkinter)
* [wxPython](wxpython)
* [PySide](pyside)
* [PyQt](pyqt)
