# Tkinter Extensions

## Introduction

Although core Tkinter has many useful widgets, it is far from complete. 
Therefore, we look for many more of these in what are called Tkinter 
extensions.

These extensions are nothing but a collection of extended Tkinter 
widgets. Also, there are literally hundreds of Tkinter extensions.
